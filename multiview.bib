	the developments of the last 10 years in the area of camera self-calibration.
	Self-calibration is an attempt to calibrate camera by finding intrinsic
	parameters that are consistent with the underlying projective geometry
	of a sequence of images. In order to solve this problem, the camera
	intrinsic constraints have been used separately and in conjunction
	with camera motion constraints or scene constraints. Most self-calibration
	algorithms are concerned with unknown but constant intrinsic camera
	parameters. Recently, camera self-calibration in the case of varying
	intrinsic camera parameters was also studied. We present the basic
	theories behind the different self-calibration techniques and discuss
	the ideas behind most of the self-calibration algorithms. },

	Curve segments are extracted by a tracking algorithm, and their centroids
	are obtained. At each channel, the generalized Hough transform of
	each curve segment in the left and the right image is evaluated.
	The epipolar constraint on the centroids of the curve segment and
	the channel size is used to limit the searching space in the right
	image. To resolve the ambiguity of the false targets (multiple matches),
	a relaxation technique is used where the initial scores of the node
	assignments are updated by the compatibility measures between the
	centroids of the curve segments. The node assignments with the highest
	score are chosen as the matching curve segments },

	image features together with points and line segments. The problem
	of space reconstruction and correspondence of two conics from two
	views is addressed in this paper. It is shown that there are two
	independent polynomial conditions on the corresponding pair of conics
	across two views, given the relative orientation of the two views.
	These two correspondence conditions are derived algebraically and
	one of them is shown to be fundamental in establishing the correspondences
	of conics. A unified closed-form solution is also developed for both
	projective reconstruction of conics in space from two uncalibrated
	camera views and metric reconstruction from two calibrated camera
	views. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the discriminality
	of the correspondence conditions and the accuracy and stability of
	the reconstruction both for simulated and real images },

	constraints for points and lines in muliple images are necessary
	but not sufficient condition for the existence of real structure
	and cameras, underlying the image correspondences. To obtain sufficient
	conditions, the following additional constraints must be imposed:
	positive scales, the existence of a plane at infinity not intersecting
	the scene, and the existence of handedness preserving cameras. We
	present modifications of the well-known matching constraints and
	also some new constraints, taking into account some of this additional
	knowledge. Not only conventional but also central panoramic cameras
	are naturally described. To achieve this, we have generalized and
	simplified Hartley's ch(e)irality theory by formulating it in the
	language of oriented projective geometry and Grassmann tensors },

The algorithm has been fully implemented, and examples are presented.",

In particular we investigate three novel minimal combinations of points and lines over three views, and give complete solutions and reconstruction methods for two of these cases: Ã¢ÂÂfour points and three lines in three viewsÃ¢ÂÂ, and Ã¢ÂÂtwo points and six lines in three viewsÃ¢ÂÂ. We show that in general there are three and seven solutions, respectively, to these cases. The reconstruction methods are tested on real and simulated data. We also give tentative results for the case of nine lines in correspondence over three views, where experiments indicate that there may be up to 36 complex solutions."

We propose a new set of quartic trivariate polynomial equations in the unknown coordinates of the plane at infinity derived under the no-skew assumption. Our new equations allow to further enforce the constancy of the principal point across all images while retrieving the plane at infinity. Six such polynomials, four of which are independent, are obtained for each triplet of images. The proposed equations can be solved along with the so-called modulus constraints and allow to improve the performance of existing methods.",
